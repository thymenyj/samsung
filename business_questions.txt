1. Can we identify customer generating revenue, that is, "total_transactionRevenue (at least bigger than 0),
    from the given dataset regarding the website behaviors?

    Yes we can identify customer generating revenue from the dataset. Every row is linked to a total transaction value, so all the visting data is linked to a customer revenue.
    We can also see that there is a large variety when it comes to total transaction value per visitor.
    
    There are no visitors below the $10.000
    2 visitors between 10.000 - 100.000 -> total 0.13M
    6 visitors between 100.000 - 1M -> 3.4M
    524 visitors between 1M - 10M -> 3.2B
    7878 visitors between 10M - 100M -> 331B
    2891 visitors between 100M - 1B -> 785B
    191 visitors between 1B - 10B -> 350B
    4 visitors between 10B - 100B -> 67.5B

    Company has a lot a high paying visitors. Small part of visitors generate large part of the revenue.

2. What are the critical factors in predicting "totals_transactionRevenue (at least bigger than 0)
    Plotted the features with non_paying vs paying customers
    -> total_hits seem important and total pageviews as expected
    -> paying vistors come mostly from referral, organic and direct
    -> large difference in social and affiliates -> maybe possibility to transfer large customer base from social media.
    -> people buy mostly from desktop -> can be because of high revenue per visitor
    -> 98 paying customers are from US but only half of the visitors. Why do asian and european customers not buy?
    -> northen America same
    -> large part is referral and organic not
    -> all visitors are from adNetworkType @ only small part from Slot Top -> Slot Top visitors are paying more often
    -> Most users are chrome. Chrome has also higher chance for paying customers compared to other. 
    -> Most paying customers come from Macintosh, then Windows. Much higher rate for mac users. Mac users use most of the time chrome then.
    -> California and New York have the most paying users. -> Mountain View -> San Francisco. More expensive areas.
    -> Traffic Source mostly youtube, googleplex.com, direct and google.
        googleplex, direct search have higher chance on visitor paying. Youtube chance on paying visitor is almost 0.

    regression for feature importance all
    -> geo city Salem -> negative
    -> traffic source referral path mail/u/0 -> positive
    -> traffic source referral path google-merchandise-store -> positive
    -> traffic source dealspotr.com -> negative
    -> geo city Atlanta -> positive
    -> geo region Georiga -> negative
    -> geo network domain -> comcastbusiness.net -> negative

    regression for feature importance only paying
    -> geo city Salem -> negative
    -> geo continent Asia -> negative
    -> geo continent Europe -> negative
    -> traffic source referral path mail/u/0 -> positive
    -> geo continent America -> negative
    -> device browser Firefox -> positive
    -> geo city Atlanta -> positive

    Hoe kan het dat America negatief bij feature importance geeft. -> influence south and central america?

3. We assume the precisely targeted communication triggers the revenue. What will be critical insight to develop the
    markting strategy in terms of customer segmentation and precision targeting in case we want to increase the number of
    "totals_transactionRevenue (at least bigger than 0)
    - Whom to communicate - customer demographics or device type, etc.
        - Geo location -> current state vs future state. -> two segments north america vs rest -> communication not effetive in asia and european
        - What is different from the communication with america.  -> are the users different?
    - When to communicate - does the time of visit matter?
        - I did not see any timestamps in the dataset. Weekday is available but it has a very low feature importance in the regression.
    - What to communicate - can we identify which type of contents influence?
        - Did not find any specified content in the dataset, only sources from the visits. In order to identify about the content I need more info about the revenue source.
        - What is possible is to determine whether the visitor is from social media or from a direct search for example.
        - From the geo locations and pay vs non pay you can see that it is very difficult for non north americans to buy.
            maybe the content is only targeted to US people and products cannot easily be bought from europeans and asians.
    - How to communicate - which communication channels?
        - What communication channels are more effective at the moment. We seperate paying customers with non paying customers.


    make different data sets based on:
    - demographics WHOM.
    - time WHEN.
    - type of content WHAT.
    - channels HOW.


NOT REGRESSION BUT CLASSIFICATION -> Y = Paying or Not paying

NEED TO SPLIT 50/50 TRUE FALSE IN ORDER TO GET GOOD CLASSIFICATION

STANDARDIZATION?
