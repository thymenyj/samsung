Technical Assessment
As discussed, we will have a face-to-face interview, including a presentation and demonstration of the
assignment.
Analyzing the website behaviors of consumers is fundamental in digital marketing. Due to
confidentiality, however, we cannot disclose the internal data for this assignment. Instead, we use the
publicly available dataset that can infer similar business questions:

Assignment: Predicting “totals_transactionRevenue (at least bigger than 0: >0)” from
Prepaired_data_of_customer_revenue_prediction dataset.
Business questions (provided by the interviewer)

bigger than 0: >0)”, from the given dataset regarding the website behaviors?
